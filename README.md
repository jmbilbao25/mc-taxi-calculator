#  MC Taxi Calculator

A modern taxi fare calculator built with Next.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. Features real-time calculations, admin panel, and comprehensive monitoring.

##  **My Learning Journey**

This project represents my journey into **DevOps and Cloud Engineering**. As someone passionate about becoming a DevOps or Cloud Engineer, I created this simple taxi calculator to get hands-on experience with the technologies that are essential in modern cloud infrastructure.

### **Why This Project?**

I wanted to build something practical while learning the core technologies that every DevOps/Cloud Engineer should know:

- **AWS EC2**: Understanding virtual machines, instance management, and cloud computing fundamentals
- **AWS RDS**: Learning managed database services and how they differ from self-hosted solutions
- **Backend API Development**: Building RESTful APIs with Express.js to understand how services communicate
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization is crucial for DevOps - learning how to package applications and manage multi-container environments
- **Database Migration**: I started with MongoDB (NoSQL) to understand document-based databases, then migrated to PostgreSQL (SQL) on AWS RDS to experience the differences between NoSQL and relational databases

### **What I Learned**

This project taught me:
- How to deploy applications on cloud infrastructure
- The importance of containerization in modern development
- Database management and migration strategies
- API design and backend development
- Monitoring and observability with Prometheus and Grafana
- The differences between NoSQL and SQL databases in real-world scenarios

### **The Migration Story**

Originally, this project used **MongoDB** - a NoSQL database that I was familiar with. However, I decided to migrate to **PostgreSQL on AWS RDS** to:
- Experience the differences between NoSQL and SQL databases
- Learn about managed database services
- Understand data migration processes
- Get familiar with relational database concepts

This migration was a valuable learning experience that gave me insights into both database paradigms and helped me understand when to use each approach.
